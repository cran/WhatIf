could fly?</em> The first known attempt to answer this question was in
1909 by J.T.C. Moore-Brabazon, who earlier the same year was the first
British pilot to fly in Britain. On the left is Moore-Brabazon in his
personal French-built Voisin aero plane. On the right is a pig in a
wicker basket behind a sign that says "I am the first pig to
fly."</small> </p>

<p>Inferences about counterfactuals are essential for prediction,
answering "what if" questions, and estimating causal effects. However,
when the counterfactuals posed are too far from the data at hand,
conclusions drawn from well-specified statistical analyses become
based largely on speculation hidden in convenient modeling assumptions
that few would be willing to defend. Unfortunately, standard
statistical approaches assume the veracity of the model rather than
revealing the degree of model-dependence, which makes this problem
hard to detect. WhatIf offers easy-to-apply methods to evaluate
counterfactuals that do not require sensitivity testing over specified
classes of models. If an analysis fails the tests offered here, then
we know that substantive inferences will be sensitive to at least some
modeling choices that are not based on empirical evidence, no matter
what method of inference one chooses to use. WhatIf is also used to
identify the areas of common support in causal inference. It is
implemented in <a href="http://gking.harvard.edu/matchit">MatchIt</a> and can easily process
<a href="http://gking.harvard.edu/zelig">Zelig</a> output objects so that counterfactuals can
be evaluated, prior to computing quantities of interest, with only one
additional command.
